       This contains XS performance enhancers for Class::C3 version 0.16 and
       higher.  The main Class::C3 package will use this package automatically
       if it can find it.  Do not use this package directly, use Class::C3
       instead.

       The test suite here is not complete, although it does verify a few
       basic things.  The best testing comes from running the Class::C3 test
       suite *after* this module is installed.

       This module won't do anything for you if you're running a version of
       Class::C3 older than 0.16.  (It's not a dependency because it would be
       circular with the optional dependency from that package to this one).
