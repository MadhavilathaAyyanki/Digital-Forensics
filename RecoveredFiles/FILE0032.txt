       keyboard - keyboard configuration file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  kkeeyybbooaarrdd file describes the properties of the keyboard. It is read
       by sseettuuppccoonn(1) in order to configure the keyboard on the  console.   In
       Debian  systems  the  default  keyboard layout is described in _/_e_t_c_/_d_e_-
       _f_a_u_l_t_/_k_e_y_b_o_a_r_d and it is shared between X and the console.

       The specification of the keyboard layout in the kkeeyybbooaarrdd file is  based
       on the XKB options XkbModel, XkbLayout, XkbVariant and XkbOptions.  Un-
       fortunately, there is little documentation how to use  them.   Descrip-
       tion  of all possible values for these options can be found in the file
       _x_o_r_g_._l_s_t.

       The file kkeeyybbooaarrdd consists of variable settings in POSIX format:

              _V_A_R_I_A_B_L_E=_V_A_L_U_E

       Only  one assignment is allowed per line.  Comments (starting with '#')
       are also allowed.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The following variables can be set.


       XXKKBBMMOODDEELL
              Specifies the XKB keyboard model name.  Default: ppcc110055  on  most
              platforms.


       XXKKBBLLAAYYOOUUTT
              Specifies  the  XKB  keyboard  layout  name. This is usually the
              country or language type of the keyboard. Default:  uuss  on  most
              platforms


       XXKKBBVVAARRIIAANNTT
              Specifies the XKB keyboard variant components. These can be used
              to further specify the keyboard  layout  details.  Default:  not
              set.


       XXKKBBOOPPTTIIOONNSS
              Specifies  the  XKB keyboard option components.  Options usually
              relate to the behavior of the special keys (<Shift>,  <Control>,
              <Alt>, <CapsLock>, etc.)  Default: not set.


       BBAACCKKSSPPAACCEE
              Determines  the behavior of <BackSpace> and <Delete> keys on the
              console.  Allowed values: bbss, ddeell and gguueessss.  In most cases  you
              can  specify gguueessss here, in which case the current terminal set-
              tings and the kernel of your operating system will  be  used  to
              determine  the  correct value.  Value bbss specifies VT100-confor-
              mant behavior: <BackSpace>  will  generate  ^^HH  (ASCII  BS)  and
              <Delete>  will  generate  ^^??   (ASCII DEL).  Value ddeell specifies
              VT220-conformant behavior: <BackSpace> will generate ^^??   (ASCII
              DEL) and <Delete> will generate a special function sequence.


       KKMMAAPP   Usually this variable will be unset but if you don't want to use
              a XKB layout on the console,  you  can  specify  an  alternative
              keymap here.  Specify a file that is suitable as input for llooaadd--
              kkeeyyss(1) on Linux or for kkbbddccoonnttrrooll(1) on FreeBSD.


FFIILLEESS
       The standard location of the kkeeyybbooaarrdd  file  is  _/_e_t_c_/_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_/_k_e_y_b_o_a_r_d.
       Description of all available keyboard models, layouts, variants and op-
       tions is available in _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_X_1_1_/_x_k_b_/_r_u_l_e_s_/_x_o_r_g_._l_s_t.  In most  cas-
       es, in _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_k_e_y_m_a_p_s_/ or _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_s_y_s_c_o_n_s_/_k_e_y_m_a_p_s_/ you will find
       several keymaps that can be used with the variable KKMMAAPP.


NNOOTTEESS
       In Debian systems, changes in _/_e_t_c_/_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_/_k_e_y_b_o_a_r_d do not become imme-
       diately visible to X.  You should either reboot the system, or use

           udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change

       In order to activate the changes on the console, run sseettuuppccoonn(1)..


BBUUGGSS
       When  a  triple-layout is used on the console, i.e. a layout with three
       XKB groups, then the group  toggling  happens  in  the  following  way:
       Group1 -> Group2 -> Group1 -> Group3.

       On  FreeBSD triple- and quadruple-layouts are not supported on the con-
       sole (only the first and the second layout are taken into account).

       The option ggrrpp::sshhiiffttss__ttooggggllee is not supported on the console.


EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The following configuration will give you the standard US QWERTY layout
       (uuss).   The  key  <Menu>  will  act as a compose key (ccoommppoossee::mmeennuu) and
       <CapsLock> will act as third control key (ccttrrll::nnooccaappss).

           XKBLAYOUT=us
           XKBVARIANT=
           XKBOPTIONS=compose:menu,ctrl:nocaps

       In the following configuration the right <Alt>  key  (ggrrpp::ttooggggllee)  will
       toggle between US QWERTY layout (uuss) and Greek (ggrr) layout.  The option
       ggrrpp__lleedd::ssccrroollll is ignored on the console but in X in means to  use  the
       ScrollLock  keyboard  led  as  indicator  for the current layout (US or
       Greek).

           XKBLAYOUT=us,gr
           XKBVARIANT=
           XKBOPTIONS=grp:toggle,grp_led:scroll

       In the following configuration the  <Control>+<Shift>  key  combination
       will  toggle (ggrrpp::ccttrrll__sshhiifftt__ttooggggllee) between French keyboard (ffrr) with-
       out dead keys (nnooddeeaaddkkeeyyss) and British (ggbb) "Dvorak" (ddvvoorraakk) keyboard.
       The  right <Win> key will be a compose-key (ccoommppoossee::rrwwiinn) and the right
       <Alt> key will function as AltGr (llvv33::llaalltt__sswwiittcchh).

           XKBLAYOUT=fr,gb
           XKBVARIANT=nodeadkeys,dvorak
           XKBOPTIONS=grp:ctrl_shift_toggle,compose:rwin,lv3:ralt_switch
