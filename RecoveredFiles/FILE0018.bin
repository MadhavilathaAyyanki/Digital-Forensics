       Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class.
       Most or all of this information can be found in other ways, but they
       aren't always very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high
       level of Perl wizardry, or strange and unusual looking code.
       Class::Inspector attempts to provide an easier, more friendly interface
       to this information.

        my $bool = Class::Inspector->installed($class);

       The "installed" static method tries to determine if a class is
       installed on the machine, or at least available to Perl. It does this
       by wrapping around "resolved_filename".

       Returns true if installed/available, false if the class is not
       installed, or "undef" if the class name is invalid.

   llooaaddeedd
        my $bool = Class::Inspector->loaded($class);

       The "loaded" static method tries to determine if a class is loaded by
       looking for symbol table entries.

       This method it uses to determine this will work even if the class does
       not have its own file, but is contained inside a single file with
       multiple classes in it. Even in the case of some sort of run-time
       loading class being used, these typically leave some trace in the
       symbol table, so an Autoload or Class::Autouse-based class should
       correctly appear loaded.

       Returns true if the class is loaded, false if not, or "undef" if the
       class name is invalid.

   ffiilleennaammee
        my $filename = Class::Inspector->filename($class);

       For a given class, returns the base filename for the class. This will
       NOT be a fully resolved filename, just the part of the filename BELOW
       the @INC entry.

         print Class->filename( 'Foo::Bar' );
         > Foo/Bar.pm

       This filename will be returned with the right separator for the local
       platform, and should work on all platforms.

       Returns the filename on success or "undef" if the class name is
       invalid.

   rreessoollvveedd__ffiilleennaammee
        my $filename = Class::Inspector->resolved_filename($class);
        my $filename = Class::Inspector->resolved_filename($class, @try_first);

       For a given class, the "resolved_filename" static method returns the
       fully resolved filename for a class. That is, the file that the class
       would be loaded from.

       This is not necessarily the file that the class WAS loaded from, as the
       value returned is determined each time it runs, and the @INC include
       path may change.

       To get the actual file for a loaded class, see the "loaded_filename"
       method.

       Returns the filename for the class, or "undef" if the class name is
       invalid.

   llooaaddeedd__ffiilleennaammee
        my $filename = Class::Inspector->loaded_filename($class);

       For a given loaded class, the "loaded_filename" static method
       determines (via the %INC hash) the name of the file that it was
       originally loaded from.

       Returns a resolved file path, or false if the class did not have it's
       own file.

   ffuunnccttiioonnss
        my $arrayref = Class::Inspector->functions($class);

       For a loaded class, the "functions" static method returns a list of the
       names of all the functions in the classes immediate namespace.

       Note that this is not the METHODS of the class, just the functions.

       Returns a reference to an array of the function names on success, or
       "undef" if the class name is invalid or the class is not loaded.

   ffuunnccttiioonn__rreeffss
        my $arrayref = Class::Inspector->function_refs($class);

       For a loaded class, the "function_refs" static method returns
       references to all the functions in the classes immediate namespace.

       Note that this is not the METHODS of the class, just the functions.

       Returns a reference to an array of "CODE" refs of the functions on
       success, or "undef" if the class is not loaded.

   ffuunnccttiioonn__eexxiissttss
        my $bool = Class::Inspector->function_exists($class, $functon);

       Given a class and function name the "function_exists" static method
       will check to see if the function exists in the class.

       Note that this is as a function, not as a method. To see if a method
       exists for a class, use the "can" method for any class or object.

       Returns true if the function exists, false if not, or "undef" if the
       class or function name are invalid, or the class is not loaded.

   mmeetthhooddss
        my $arrayref = Class::Inspector->methods($class, @options);

       For a given class name, the "methods" static method will returns ALL
       the methods available to that class. This includes all methods
       available from every class up the class' @ISA tree.

       Returns a reference to an array of the names of all the available
       methods on success, or "undef" if the class name is invalid or the
       class is not loaded.

       A number of options are available to the "methods" method that will
       alter the results returned. These should be listed after the class
       name, in any order.

         # Only get public methods
         my $method = Class::Inspector->methods( 'My::Class', 'public' );

       public
           The "public" option will return only 'public' methods, as defined
           by the Perl convention of prepending an underscore to any 'private'
           methods. The "public" option will effectively remove any methods
           that start with an underscore.

       private
           The "private" options will return only 'private' methods, as
           defined by the Perl convention of prepending an underscore to an
           private methods. The "private" option will effectively remove an
           method that do not start with an underscore.

       full
           "methods" normally returns just the method name. Supplying the
           "full" option will cause the methods to be returned as the full
           names. That is, instead of returning "[ 'method1', 'method2',
           'method3' ]", you would instead get "[ 'Class::method1',
           'AnotherClass::method2', 'Class::method3' ]".

       expanded
           The "expanded" option will cause a lot more information about
           method to be returned. Instead of just the method name, you will
           instead get an array reference containing the method name as a
           single combined name, a la "full", the separate class and method,
           and a CODE ref to the actual function ( if available ). Please note
           that the function reference is not guaranteed to be available.
           "Class::Inspector" is intended at some later time, to work with
           modules that have some kind of common run-time loader in place (
           e.g "Autoloader" or "Class::Autouse" for example.

           The response from "methods( 'Class', 'expanded' )" would look
           something like the following.

             [
               [ 'Class::method1',   'Class',   'method1', \&Class::method1   ],
               [ 'Another::method2', 'Another', 'method2', \&Another::method2 ],
               [ 'Foo::bar',         'Foo',     'bar',     \&Foo::bar         ],
             ]

   ssuubbccllaasssseess
        my $arrayref = Class::Inspector->subclasses($class);

       The "subclasses" static method will search then entire namespace (and
       thus aallll currently loaded classes) to find all classes that are
       subclasses of the class provided as a the parameter.

       The actual test will be done by calling "isa" on the class as a static
       method. (i.e. "My::Class->isa($class)".

       Returns a reference to a list of the loaded classes that match the
       class provided, or false is none match, or "undef" if the class name
       provided is invalid.
