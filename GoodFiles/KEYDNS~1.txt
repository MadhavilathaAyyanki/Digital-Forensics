       key.dns_resolver.conf - Kernel DNS resolver config

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This file is used by the key.dns_resolver(5) program to set parameters.
       Unless otherwise overridden with the --cc flag, the program reads:

              /etc/key.dns_resolver.conf

       Configuration options are given in kkeeyy[[==vvaalluuee]] form, where vvaalluuee is op-
       tional.   If  present,  the value may be surrounded by a pair of single
       ('') or double quotes ("") which will be  stripped  off.   The  special
       characters  in  the  value may be escaped with a backslash to turn them
       into ordinary characters.

       Lines beginning with a '#' are considered comments and ignored.  A  '#'
       symbol anywhere after the '=' makes the rest of the line into a comment
       unless the '#' is inside a quoted section or is escaped.

       Leading and trailing spaces and spaces around the '='  symbol  will  be
       stripped off.

       Available options include:

       ddeeffaauulltt__ttttll==<<nnuummbbeerr>>
              The  number  of  seconds  to  set  as the expiration on a cached
              record.  This will be overridden if the program manages  to  re-
              trieve  TTL  information along with the addresses (if, for exam-
              ple, it accesses the DNS directly).  The default is  5  seconds.
              The value must be in the range 1 to INT_MAX.

       The  file  can also include comments beginning with a '#' character un-
       less otherwise suppressed by being inside a quoted value or  being  es-
       caped with a backslash.
