       ccuuppss--bbrroowwsseedd has four independently switchable functions:

       1.  Browse Bonjour broadcasts of remote printers and create/remove  lo-
           cal raw queues pointing to these printers.

       2.  Browse  CUPS  broadcasts of remote printers and create/remove local
           raw queues pointing to these printers.

       3.  Browse an LDAP server for  printers  and  create/remove  local  raw
           queues pointing to these printers.

       4.  Broadcast local queues with the CUPS protocol.

       Note  that  2.  and 4. are only to allow communication with legacy CUPS
       servers (1.5.x or older) on the remote machine(s). The standard  method
       to broadcast for shared/network printers to broadcast their presence is
       Bonjour. The CUPS broadcasting/browsing protocol is deprecated.

       cups-browsed can be run permanently (from system boot to  shutdown)  or
       on-demand  (for  example to save resources on mobile devices). For run-
       ning it on-demand an auto-shutdown feature  can  be  activated  to  let
       cups-browsed  terminate  when  it does not have queues any more to take
       care of.

       --vv,, --dd,, ----ddeebbuugg
              Debug mode, verbose logging to stderr

       --ll,, ----llooggffiillee
              Debug logging into /var/log/cups/cups-browsed_log file.

       --cc _c_o_n_f_i_g_-_f_i_l_e
              Uses the alternative configuration file _c_o_n_f_i_g_-_f_i_l_e  instead  of
              the standard one.

              Supply  configuration options via the command line. You can sup-
              ply any line which also could  be  put  into  the  configuration
              file,  but  note  that  due to the spaces the line has to be put
              into quotes, or for a simple key/value pair  the  space  between
              key  and value can get replaced by '='. If command-line-supplied
              configuration settings are contradicting with the  ones  in  the
              configuration  file, the ones in the configuration file will get
              used.

       ----aauuttoosshhuuttddoowwnn==mmooddee
              Auto shutdown mode, mmooddee is ooffff for no  auto  shutdown,  oonn  for
              auto  shutdown being active, and aavvaahhii for control by the avahi-
              daemon being run on-demand,  getting  auto-shutdown  turned  off
              while  avahi-daemon  is present and on when avahi-daemon is shut
              down.

              What cups-browsed considers as inactivity for auto-shutdown. iinn--
              aaccttiivviittyy--ttyyppee  set  to  nnoo--qquueeuueess (the default) means that auto-
              shutdown is initiated if there are no queues generated by  cups-
              browsed any more, nnoo--jjoobbss means that auto-shutdown will get ini-
              tiated if all queues generated by cups-browsed are without jobs.

       ----aauuttoosshhuuttddoowwnn--ttiimmeeoouutt==ttiimmeeoouutt
              ttiimmeeoouutt tells after how many seconds  cups-browsed  should  shut
              down  if it has no local queues set up for any discovered remote
              printer any more or jobs on these.  Default  is  30  seconds.  0
              means immediate shutdown.

       --hh,, ----hheellpp,, ----vveerrssiioonn

       Please  take references to cups 1.6.x to include newer versions.  Simi-
       larly, cups 1.5.x is intended to encompass older versions too.

       In environments with only cups 1.6.x servers and  clients  (plus  ccuuppss--
       bbrroowwsseedd  on  either server or client or both) the function described in
       1.  enables the automatic discovery of remote queues and their  display
       in printing dialogues of applications and with command line tools.

       The  facility  provided by 3. allows printers that are registered in an
       LDAP server to be added as local queues. CUPS servers 1.5.x are able to
       automatically register printers in LDAP. The facility provided by ccuuppss--
       bbrroowwsseedd allows a filter string to further limit the printers  that  are
       browsed from LDAP.

       The  facility provided by 4. means that servers running cups 1.6.x plus
       ccuuppss--bbrroowwsseedd can broadcast their local queues so that clients with cups
       1.5.x  get  these  queues automatically available. The outcome of 2. is
       that clients running cups 1.6.x plus  ccuuppss--bbrroowwsseedd  can  use  the  CUPS
       broadcasts  from  servers  with cups 1.5.x. As with browsing of Bonjour
       broadcasts, the created local raw queues are available to  applications
       and command line tools.

       by others.
