       Method modifiers are a convenient feature from the CLOS (Common Lisp
       Object System) world.

       In its most basic form, a method modifier is just a method that calls
       "$self->SUPER::foo(@_)". I for one have trouble remembering that exact
       invocation, so my classes seldom re-dispatch to their base classes.
       Very bad!

       "Class::Method::Modifiers" provides three modifiers: "before",
       "around", and "after". "before" and "after" are run just before and
       after the method they modify, but can not really affect that original
       method. "around" is run in place of the original method, with a hook to
       easily call that original method.  See the "MODIFIERS" section for more
       details on how the particular modifiers work.

       One clear benefit of using "Class::Method::Modifiers" is that you can
       define multiple modifiers in a single namespace. These separate
       modifiers don't need to know about each other. This makes top-down
       design easy. Have a base class that provides the skeleton methods of
       each operation, and have plugins modify those methods to flesh out the
       specifics.

       Parent classes need not know about "Class::Method::Modifiers". This
       means you should be able to modify methods in _a_n_y subclass. See
       Term::VT102::ZeroBased for an example of subclassing with
       "Class::Method::Modifiers".

       In short, "Class::Method::Modifiers" solves the problem of making sure
       you call "$self->SUPER::foo(@_)", and provides a cleaner interface for
       it.

       As of version 1.00, "Class::Method::Modifiers" is faster in some cases
       than Moose. See _b_e_n_c_h_m_a_r_k_/_m_e_t_h_o_d___m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r_s_._p_l in the Moose
       distribution.

       "Class::Method::Modifiers" also provides an additional "modifier" type,
       "fresh"; see below.

MMOODDIIFFIIEERRSS
       All modifiers let you modify one or multiple methods at a time. The
       names of multiple methods can be provided as a list or as an array-
       reference. Examples:

        before 'method' => sub { ... };
        before 'method1', 'method2' => sub { ... };
        before [ 'method1', 'method2' ] => sub { ... };

   bbeeffoorree mmeetthhoodd((ss)) ==>> ssuubb {{ ...... }};;
       "before" is called before the method it is modifying. Its return value
       is totally ignored. It receives the same @_ as the method it is
       modifying would have received. You can modify the @_ the original
       method will receive by changing $_[0] and friends (or by changing
       anything inside a reference).  This is a feature!

   aafftteerr mmeetthhoodd((ss)) ==>> ssuubb {{ ...... }};;
       "after" is called after the method it is modifying. Its return value is
       totally ignored. It receives the same @_ as the method it is modifying
       received, mostly. The original method can modify @_ (such as by
       changing $_[0] or references) and "after" will see the modified
       version. If you don't like this behavior, specify both a "before" and
       "after", and copy the @_ during "before" for "after" to use.

   aarroouunndd mmeetthhoodd((ss)) ==>> ssuubb {{ ...... }};;
       "around" is called instead of the method it is modifying. The method
       you're overriding is passed in as the first argument (called $orig by
       convention).  Watch out for contextual return values of $orig.

       You can use "around" to:

       Pass $orig a different @_
               around 'method' => sub {
                   my $orig = shift;
                   my $self = shift;
                   $orig->($self, reverse @_);
               };

       Munge the return value of $orig
               around 'method' => sub {
                   my $orig = shift;
                   ucfirst $orig->(@_);
               };

       Avoid calling $orig -- conditionally
               around 'method' => sub {
                   my $orig = shift;
                   return $orig->(@_) if time() % 2;
                   return "no dice, captain";
               };

   ffrreesshh mmeetthhoodd((ss)) ==>> ssuubb {{ ...... }};;
       (Available since version 2.00)

       Unlike the other modifiers, this does not modify an existing method.
       Ordinarily, "fresh" merely installs the coderef as a method in the
       appropriate class; but if the class hierarchy already contains a method
       of the same name, an exception is thrown.  The idea of this "modifier"
       is to increase safety when subclassing.  Suppose you're writing a
       subclass of a class Some::Base, and adding a new method:

           package My::Subclass;
           use base 'Some::Base';

           sub foo { ... }

       If a later version of Some::Base also adds a new method named "foo",
       your method will shadow that method.  Alternatively, you can use
       "fresh" to install the additional method into your subclass:

           package My::Subclass;
           use base 'Some::Base';

           use Class::Method::Modifiers 'fresh';

           fresh 'foo' => sub { ... };

       Now upgrading Some::Base to a version with a conflicting "foo" method
       will cause an exception to be thrown; seeing that error will give you
       the opportunity to fix the problem (perhaps by picking a different
       method name in your subclass, or similar).

       Creating fresh methods with "install_modifier" (see below) provides a
       way to get similar safety benefits when adding local monkeypatches to
       existing classes; see
       <http://aaroncrane.co.uk/talks/monkey_patching_subclassing/>.

       For API compatibility reasons, this function is exported only when you
       ask for it specifically, or for ":all".

   iinnssttaallll__mmooddiiffiieerr $$ppaacckkaaggee,, $$ttyyppee,, @@nnaammeess,, ssuubb {{ ...... }}
       "install_modifier" is like "before", "after", "around", and "fresh" but
       it also lets you dynamically select the modifier type ('before',
       'after', 'around', 'fresh') and package that the method modifiers are
       installed into. This expert-level function is exported only when you
       ask for it specifically, or for ":all".

NNOOTTEESS
       All three normal modifiers; "before", "after", and "around"; are
       exported into your namespace by default. You may "use
       Class::Method::Modifiers ()" to avoid modifying your namespace. I may
       steal more features from Moose, namely "super", "override", "inner",
       "augment", and whatever the Moose folks come up with next.

       Note that the syntax and semantics for these modifiers is directly
       borrowed from Moose (the implementations, however, are not).

       Class::Trigger shares a few similarities with
       "Class::Method::Modifiers", and they even have some overlap in purpose
       -- both can be used to implement highly pluggable applications. The
       difference is that Class::Trigger provides a mechanism for easily
       letting parent classes to invoke hooks defined by other code.
       "Class::Method::Modifiers" provides a way of overriding/augmenting
       methods safely, and the parent class need not know about it.

   ::llvvaalluuee MMEETTHHOODDSS
       When adding "before" or "after" modifiers, the wrapper method will be
       an lvalue method if the wrapped sub is, and assigning to the method
       will propagate to the wrapped method as expected.  For "around"
       modifiers, it is the modifier sub that determines if the wrapper method
       is an lvalue method.

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
       It is erroneous to modify a method that doesn't exist in your class's
       inheritance hierarchy. If this occurs, an exception will be thrown when
       the modifier is defined.

       It doesn't yet play well with "caller". There are some "TODO" tests for
       this.  Don't get your hopes up though!

       Applying modifiers to array lvalue methods is not fully supported.
       Attempting to assign to an array lvalue method that has an "after"
       modifier applied will result in an error.  Array lvalue methods are not
       well supported by perl in general, and should be avoided.

       This module was bumped to 1.00 following a complete reimplementation,
       to indicate breaking backwards compatibility. The "guard" modifier was
       removed, and the internals are completely different.

       The new version is a few times faster with half the code. It's now even
       faster than Moose.

       Any code that just used modifiers should not change in behavior, except
       to become more correct. And, of course, faster. :)

       Thanks to Stevan Little for Moose, I would never have known about
       method modifiers otherwise.

       Thanks to Matt Trout and Stevan Little for their advice.
