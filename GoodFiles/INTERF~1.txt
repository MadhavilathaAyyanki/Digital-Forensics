       interface-order - resolvconf configuration file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  file  _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_c_o_n_f_/_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e_-_o_r_d_e_r is used to control the order
       in which resolvconf nameserver information  records  are  processed  by
       those  resolvconf  update scripts that consult this file.  (The name of
       the file is apt because a resolvconf nameserver information  record  is
       named after the interface with which it is associated.)

       The file contains a sequence of shell glob patterns, one per line.  The
       position of a record in the order is the point at which its name  first
       matches a pattern.

       Patterns may not contain whitespace, slashes or initial dots or tildes.
       Blank lines and lines beginning with a '#' are ignored.

       Resolvconf update scripts  in  _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_c_o_n_f_/_u_p_d_a_t_e_._d_/  that  consult
       this  file  include  the current default versions of _d_n_s_m_a_s_q, _p_d_n_s_d and
       _l_i_b_c.  (Actually they don't read the file directly; they call the util-
       ity  program  _/_l_i_b_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_c_o_n_f_/_l_i_s_t_-_r_e_c_o_r_d_s  which  lists records in the
       specified order and omits the names of empty records.)
